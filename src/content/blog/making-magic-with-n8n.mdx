This is a great example of how n8n works simply.

### How It Began

n8n is a relatively new tool in the tech world. Imagine a picture of an old, clunky computer from the early 2000s next to a sleek, modern smartphone â€“ that's kind of like comparing older automation tools to n8n. It started as a personal project because the creator wanted an easier way to connect his own apps.  He realized other people probably had the same problem, and so n8n was born! Itâ€™s a perfect example of easy n8n history.
